    "This example will be more in-depth than the first few, but a lot of the principles that we have already applied also apply here. As always, we'll go through it step by step and I'll do my best to explain each part so that it makes sense and is as easy to follow as I can make it. In this final example, we will be looking at Generative Adversarial Networks - affectionately known as GANs. The concept of GANs were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his team in 2014 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), where they \"proposed a new framework for estimating generative models via an an adversarial process\". I'll get into this in much more detail, but essentially what is happening here is that we are going to train two neural networks (that will be adversaries), that will compete against one another in order to improve. One will be reffered to as the Discriminator and the other will be known as the Generator. We combine both of these networks to form a combined model known as the GAN for training. Once training has been completed, we want to be able to use the *trained* Generator network independently to generate new things!\n",

    "The image above looks rather unassuming, it is simply a row of portraits of four different people. The interesting thing however, is that none of these people actually exist. They are not real. Each of these images has been generated by a Generative Adversarial Network known as StyleGAN. StyleGAN is a sophisticated GAN that has been curated and trained by NVIDIA and represents the state-of-the-art results in data-driven unconditional generative image modelling and is an impressive testament as to the possibilities of Generative Networks. Here is another video that demonstrates the capabilities of these methods (which is only 2 minutes long so I recommend you watch it because it's v cool) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5U4NgVGAwg. With that being said, lets take a closer look as to how these things actually work.\n",

    "The Generative Adversarial Network is a framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process in which two neural networks compete against each other during training. It is a useful machine learning technique that learns to generate fake samples indistinguishable from real ones via a competitive game. Whilst this may sound a little confusing, the GAN is nothing more than a combined model where two neural networks are joined together; these are known as the Discriminator $D$ and the Generator $G$. The Discriminator $D$ is a classification network that is set up to maximise the probability of assigning the correct label to real (label 1) or fake (label 0) samples. Meanwhile, the Generator $G$ is trying to fool $D$ and generate new samples that the Discriminator believes came from the training set. Mathematically speaking, this corresponds to the following two-player minimax game with value function $V(G,D)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](./Figures/minmax.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is the input to $D$ from the training set, $z$ is a vector of latent values input to $G$, $E_x$ is the expected value overall real data instances, $D(x)$ is the Discriminator’s estimate of the probability that real data instance $x$ is real, $E_z$ is the expected value over all random inputs to the generator and $D(G(z))$ is the discriminator’s estimate of the probability that a fake instance is real. The diagram above should help this bit make sense. To reiterate, the primary goal of $G$ is to fool $D$ and generate new samples that $D$ believes came from the training set (real). The primary goal of $D$ is to correctly classify real/fake samples by assigning a label of 0 to generated samples indicating a fake, and a label of 1 to true samples indicating that it is real and came from the training set. The training procedure for $G$ is to maximise the probablity of $D$ making a mistake i.e. an incorrect classification. In the space of arbitrary functions $G$ and $D$, a unique solution exists, with $G$ able to reproduce data with the same distribution as the training set and the output from $D$ ≈ 0.5 for all samples, which simply indicates that the discriminator can no longer differentiate between the training data and the data generated by $G$. Or in other words, the Generator $G$ has got so good at generating 'fake' data that $D$ can no longer tell the difference. The image below is taken from Google's training documentation about GANs and is worth a read as it (obviously) does a good job at explaining some of these concepts (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan).\n",

    "## Training Set\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to decide what we want our generative network to generate. Of course, NVIDIA's sophisticated StyleGAN is capable of generating human faces, but GANs are capable of generating new data regardless of the form that it comes in. GANs can be used to generate new audio signals, new images, new time-series data etc. GANs are capable of generating new data that is representative of the data that it was trained on (the training set). Therefore, in large, a key factor in the success of the GAN model lies in the quality of the training set. In this example, we will create a simple training set from the function $y=sin(x)$ and use the trained generator to produce similar values!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Throughout this example I may use terms such as 'real' and 'fake' when referring to data. Real refers to data samples that come from the training set and 'fake' samples refer to any data that is produced by the Generator.\n",

    "### Create Training (Target) Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous examples we had used the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. This is nice because not only is it a comprehensive dataset, but it is also labelled, properly structured, the images have been transformed/resized to give the machine learning algorithm the best chance to learn. But of course, depending on the problem that you are considering there will not always be a perfect dataset available. More often than not, you will have to create a training set yourself and structure it appropriately. Again, in this example we are just going to use the function $y=sin(x)$ to create a training set given a range of $x$ values between 0 and 2$\\pi$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data will exist as a 2-D array consisting of the $x$ and corresponding $y$ values of the $sin(x)$ function. We can start by creating a new variable called `dataset` and preallocate an array of zero values with the number of rows dependant on the number of samples we would like, in this case I choose 20, and 2 columns for the $x$ and corresponding $y$ values. We use the `np.linspace()` function to create an array with `n1` equally spaced samples between 0 and 2$\\pi$ and allocate them to the first (index = 0) column of the preallocated `dataset` array. We then use the `np.sin()` function to compute the sin values of each of the values in the first column and allocate them to the second column (index=1) of the `dataset` array. Finally, the `pyplot.scatter()` function from the `matplotlib` library is used to plot the training set. Of course, if you would like to change the number of values in this dataset you can do so by changing the value of `n1`."

    "### Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section will list and talk through a bunch of different functions that we use in the training algorithm, but lets discuss how they work first. The majority of these functions are used to prepare the inputs to the Generator $G$ and the Discriminator $D$. If you have worked with functions in MATLAB then you might recall the syntax looks something like `function [y1,...,yN] = function_name(x1,...,xN)` where $x$ refers to the input variables and $y$ refers to the output variables. These functions are useful because there are often blocks of code that we might wish to repeat, and isntead of repeating the entire block of code, it is much better practice to remove the clutter and call a function that computes that block of code. Also, any of the variables created within the function that are not required as output are not saved as a global variable and will not take up unecessary memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the functionality is the same but the syntax is a little different. In order to define a function, we call `def` before naming the function. Take a look at the simple example below:"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "Here, we name the function `simple_function()`. You will notice that the function takes two inputs `a` and `b` and we define that by including them in the function parentheses and separating them with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note the colon after the function, this is important as it initalises the function and lets Python know that the next bit of code you write will define what the function will actually do!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of the function are defined by the `return` statement. In this function we perform a simple addition of two input variables `a` and `b` and label that variable `c`. Adding `return c` at the end of the function does two things, it tells Python that the function statement is complete and also that we wish to return the variable `c` for use in the rest of our code! Note that the function here could be much more complicated with many more operations and variables within - if we wish to return additional variables for use in the rest of the code, we can simply return more values such as `return c, d, e, f, g` etc. Now we have defined a function, lets use it!"

    "You can see that we can define variables `a` and `b` and insert them into the `simple_function()` that we defined previously. We can set this function equal to a new variable `c` to store the output from that function in variable `c`. If we print `c`, as expected the value is 3 (1+2). This is fine and it works, but there are a few more things you should be aware about. Python functions are very flexible! When we defined the function earlier, we named the variables `a` and `b`, but you'll see that it doesn't actually matter and we could have named them anything. How the variables are defined are only important in the function definition itself, so you'll see that this also works!"

This will make it easier for the Discriminator to label samples that come from the Generator as fake. We therefore create a simple function named `take_real_samples()` as it is simply taking real samples from the training set and will allow us to input them into the Discriminator for training.

In NVIDIA's StyleGAN they intentionally add noise to different layers of their neural networks during training and find that the output from the trained networks become more flexible and less specific.

However, if a generator produces an especially plausible output, the generator may learn to produce only that output. In fact, the generator is always trying to find the one output that seems most plausible to the discriminator. If the generator starts producing the same output (or a small set of outputs) over and over again, the discriminator's best strategy is to learn to always reject that output. But if the next generation of discriminator gets stuck in a local minimum and doesn't find the best strategy, then it's too easy for the next generator iteration to find the most plausible output for the current discriminator. Each iteration of generator over-optimizes for a particular discriminator, and the discriminator never manages to learn its way out of the trap. As a result the generators rotate through a small set of output types. This form of GAN failure is called mode collapse.\" - Google GAN Tutorial (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/problems) "

In this example, we are dealing with numeric data so a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network makes sense. We will define each network individually before creating a combined GAN model. As always, it is important for us to consider the shape of the input/output entering and leaving the networks. In the case of $D$, each input sample will be a vector containing two values - one for the $x$ value and another for its corresponding $y$ value - therefore 2 nodes in the input layer of the MLP network. Recall that $D$ is nothing more than a classification network, it's output will therefore be a single node that outputs a value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the confidence that it has that a sample came from a real (label = 1) or a fake (label = 0) distribution. The $G$ network is the latent input we discussed earlier. Recall that the latent input is nothing more than a vector of random numbers, so it's size will be equal to variable `latent_dim` which we can define later. The primary goal of $G$ is to generate samples that $$ believes came from the training set, and a single sample consists of an $x$ value and a corresponding $y$ value.

Initializers allow us to define the way to set the initial random weights of keras layers (see keras docs for more info - https://keras.io/api/layers/initializers/.

Again we compile the model to define the loss function, optimizer and metrics we wish to track during training. You may have noticed that we include `disciminator.trainable = False`, the reason for this wil be explained in more detail shortly, but in short it is because the combined GAN model is used to train the Generator only. In order to train the Geneator and update it's parameters, the loss function requires $D(G(z))$ which corresponds to the Discriminators classification of the output of the Generators output given latent input $z$. The primary goal of $G$ is to generate fake samples that the Discriminator believes to be real, therefore for a given latent input $z$, we want the Discriminator to believe that a sample $G(z)$ has the same represenation as an input sample from training set $x$.

We have defined functions that let us extract data from the training set and label it as real data accordingly (label = 0), a function that defines a random latent input from a Gaussian distribution, and finally a function that allows us to use $G$ to make predictions! We have also defined the acrhitecture of the Discriminator $D$, Generator $G$ and the combined GAN model. We can now start to develop the algorithm that controls the training procedure by defining a `train()` function and we will monitor the performance of the network during training with an additional function named `check_performance()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets consider the `check_performance()` function. You can see that it takes inputs `epoch`, `generator`, `discriminator`, `latent_dim` and a default setting `n=10`. Variables `epochs` and `latent_dim` will be defined later. The function begins by calling the `take_real_samples(n)` function to extract real samples from the training set. We make the function equal to `x_real` and `y_real` as the function returns two variables, the first of which is the training data itself, and the second is the corresponding label (label=1 for real data). The value `n` simply dictates the number of samples we take from the training set. If `n` > than the number of samples in the training set, it will simply take all of the values from the training set. Next we call the `discriminator.evaluate()` attribute from the $D$ model to evaluate the performance of $D$ at that point during the training process. The `discriminator.evaluate()` function is useful as the model will not train on any data passed into the network. It takes both the training data and the label as input, we set the `verbose=0` simply to prevent any output. The evaluate function returns the values of any metrics that are being tracked, if we call `discriminator.metrics_names` we will see `['loss', 'accuracy']` printed. We can choose to monitor either, neither or both of these values if we wish. But lets say that we just want to monitor the accuracy, we can use the `_` command to ignore the first returned variable (in this case the loss) so that `_, acc_real` will only return the accuracy from that evaluation of the discriminator. We do a similar thing by calling `generate_fake_samples()` to store the fake data generated by $G$ and the fake label (label=0). We then call the `discriminator.evaluate()` once again but this time we evaluate the discriminator on the fake samples and test its performance! Again, we use the `_` command in Python to ignore the first returned variable (loss) and we stored the accuracy of the discriminator on the fake data (from generator) into variable `acc_fake`. We can then call the `print()` function to output the accuracies during training for that given epoch number. Finally, we can use the `matplotlib` library to plot some of the results. We plot the `real` data we used from the training set (as red crosses) and the `fake` data too! "

Obviously you can train for shorter or longer if you wish. `n_batch` determines the number of samples that are input to the network in that iteration, this is important when working with big data as you may need to lower the batch size so that you do not exceed the memory limits of your hardware (CPU/GPU). `check_it` is another default value that we use to trigger the `check_performance` function. \n",

This makes it even more difficult for $G$ to produce samples that $D$ believes to be real and as such can result in unsuccessful training.

    "The grey points on the graph represnt points generated by the GAN network. The red scatter points represent 10 points (defined earlier as `n`) randomly taken from the training set (which was 50 points on a sin wave from 0 - 2$\\pi$). You can see that early in the training cycle (1000 iterations), the points generated by the Generator is not representative of the training set. Instead, it appears as a cloud of points with no real correlation or pattern. As training progresses, you can see that at 10,000 iterations the generated samples match the shape of the sin curve much more closely. This shows that the GAN network is learning from the training set and the generator is optimising such that it is able to generate realistic points! Over time, the network continues to improve and at 50,000 iterations the generated samples match very closely with the sin function across the entire range!\n",

    "#### Using the model to generate new data\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the `generate_fake_samples` function that we defined earlier to generate new samples. The function takes the `generator` model as input (obviously as it needs to use the trained generator to generate new points), as well as the latent input (10) and number of points we would like to be generated (100). We make the function equal to `A, _` as the function returns two values; the generated samples and their label. In this case, we're only interested in the generated samples so we can ignore the labels (second returned variable) by using Pythons built in `_` function. We can then plot the generated samples against the sin curve to visualise the results!"

    "This model was successful as the output spans across the entire distribution of the training set. We would be less pleased if there was a lot of localisation, i.e. majority of generated points focussed around a small part of the sin function. This would be an example of mode collapse! We are also satisfied as the generated samples lie very closely to the sin function indicating that the Generator is able to produce accurate samples. If you are wanting to play around with the model further, perhaps try some of the following suggestions and run the model again: \n",

    "1. Play around with the size of the latent input - what happens to the output if we reduce the input size to 3?\n",
    "2. See what happens when `n` is higher - i.e. taking more samples from the training set. Set `n` to a high value to use the entire training data.\n",
