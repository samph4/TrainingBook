    "Python is a relatively easy language to learn as it shares a lot of similarities with MATLAB. When we want to create neural networks and ai algorithms, its much easier to use Python as the programming language as you have access to many more tools and support than you would have with MATLAB. Whilst MATLAB is a nice integrated environment that does has excellent support, you are often dependent on the packages that they release and the overall support for machine learning tools is definitely limited when compared to the Python development environment. Python is nice because you have access to many open-source libraries that have pre-written functions that make your life a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic example of this is something like the linspace function in MATLAB, upon loading MATLAB you'll be able to type into the command window ' a = linspace(0,10,10)' and it will store a variable a and print it out. Python works a little differently. Out of the box the linspace function is not present in the python libraries, but instead you can 'import' a library that gives you that same functionality. In the cell block below, we import a module named 'numpy'. This is a very popular package which contains a lot of the data manipulation tools you typically find and use in MATLAB. In python at the top of the document, it is good practice to import all of the libraries that you will use in the rest of your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a bunch of different libraries people use to develop machine learning algorithms, from PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, FastAI etc etc, they all have positive attributes and negative attributes and quite often its a matter of preference which one you should use. I tend to use Keras to develop my models as it uses a simple syntax to write the code (functions are elegantly written and easy to understand), it shared the most comparisons with MATLAB so made sense in my head and gives you all of the flexibility you could ever really need ."

So if we call `dir(numpy)`, all attributes associated with the `numpy` module will be printed and you can then select the function that suits your needs. If you are unsure as to what any of the functions do, then often you can call the `help` function. Which again is built into Python.
