    "I'll structure this section so that it exists as a resource more than anything; find the section that corresponds to the work (or task) that you are trying to do and find the packages that might be able to help. Please note that when we import modules into Python, all that we are really doing is importing new functions that we can use directly in our algorithms. There is nothing stopping us creating these functions ourselves and coding everything explicitly from the ground up in Python, just understand that that is an endeavour that will take a lot of time and these functions are available primarily at your convenience. The open-source support network in Python is one of the coding languages strongest attributes as users can share useful bits of code amongst each other with the goal of making everybody more productive. If you are coming from a MATLAB background, it may seem that MATLAB has all of the functionality built in. But that isn't completely the case, you may remember whenever you first install MATLAB that you have the option to select 'add-on'toolboxes that provide additional functionality such as the 'Control System Toolbox', Signal Processing Toolbox' etc, this is pretty much the same principle as what we are doing here.\n",
