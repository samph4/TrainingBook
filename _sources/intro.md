Introduction
============================

This book was written with the intention of making Python and Machine Learning more accessible for engineers with a background in MATLAB. I made the transition from exclusively coding and developing all of my algorithms using MATLAB, but since I have swapped to Python I haven't looked back. That doesn't for a moment mean that it was a smooth transition for me, but with the help of this book, hopefully it will be for you!

This book was written in JupyterBooks which is a new offering from the Jupyter team that allows us to publish notebooks in a format that is easier to follow and understand. It will allow you to use the search bar to quickly find any terms/relevant information and the navigation tree (should) make it straight forward to navigate between pages. This is a work in progress and at this point it is far from finished, however over time this should become a very useful resource.

I'll be including different tutorials that will walk you through some different machine learning applications such that you become familiar with some of the most common neural networks utilised (MLP, CNN, LSTM), before diving a little deeper into ones more complex such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This book will also act as a Python reference and I will include a page with many useful Python tips/definitions that will hopefully help out a bit.

Enjoy!
